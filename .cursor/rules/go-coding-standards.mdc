# Go Coding Standards

## General Guidelines:

- Follow standard Go formatting with `gofmt`
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions and types
- Handle errors appropriately - don't ignore them
- Use context.Context for cancellation and timeouts

## Operator-Specific Patterns:

- Controllers should follow the controller-runtime patterns
- Use structured logging with the controller-runtime logger
- Implement proper reconciliation logic with error handling
- Use client-go patterns for Kubernetes API interactions
- Follow the operator SDK conventions

## Error Handling:

- Return errors from functions that can fail
- Wrap errors with context using fmt.Errorf
- Use appropriate error types for different scenarios
- Log errors at appropriate levels

## Testing:

- Write unit tests for business logic
- Use testify/assert for assertions
- Mock external dependencies properly
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
